Description: Transfer learning enhances the performance of a target model by leveraging data from related source populations. In this work, we consider a practical setting where only the parameter estimates of the pre-trained source models are accessible. We propose a novel flexible angle-based transfer learning (angleTL) method, which leverages the concordance between the source and the target model parameters. This package implements the algorithms proposed in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12759>.
