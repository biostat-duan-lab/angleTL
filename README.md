# angleTL

Transfer learning enhances the performance of a target model by leveraging data from related source populations. In this work, we consider a practical setting where only the parameter estimates of the pre-trained source models are accessible. We propose a novel flexible angle-based transfer learning (angleTL) method, which leverages the concordance between the source and the target model parameters. This package implements the algorithms proposed in Gu T, Han Y, Duan R. “Robust angle-based transfer learning in high dimensions” [ArXiv]([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12759>.]).
